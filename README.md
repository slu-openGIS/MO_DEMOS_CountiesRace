### Abstract
These data contain total population counts as well as counts for census race categories for each Missouri county. These data are derived from the 2016 5-year American Community Survey estimates. These data can be previewed interactively using the [`.geoJSON` file in this repository](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/MO_DEMOS_CountiesRace/blob/master/geoJSON/MO_DEMOS_CountiesRace.geoJSON).

### Use with R
The [`gateway` package](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/gateway) can be used to download and import these data as a simple feature object:

```r
moCounties <- gateway::gw_get_repo("MO_DEMOS_CountiesRace")
```
